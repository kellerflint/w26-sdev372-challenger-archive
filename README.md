# Project-Plans
## Project Overview
### Challenger Archive
- **Problem Statement:** In an individual sport (or one on one) it forces you to
focus, adapt, and remember aspects of your opponent and their unique style of how
they play the game. The longer you play the game the more oppenents you are forced
to memorize and at some point it becomes a hassle trying to remember what someone
you played against weeks/months/years ago. This website gives the user the
opportunity to record aspects of their opponents physicality, styles, and
attributes as their own personal record to improve in the future.
- **Target Users:** Pool players, MMA fighters, other sports (if we have time)
## Feature Breakdown
- **MVP Features:** Core functionality we could implement are giving the user two
options for sports they play between pool and mma and some form of a user login to
a unique database for each user to record their specifc opponents
- **Extended Features:** Some additional features could be adding different sports
such as fencing, tennis, gymnastics etc. Also adding features like adding video of
a previous game you've played against them to see how you can improve your own
flaws. Win percentage?
## Data Model Planning
- **Core Entities:** Strings, Numbers (to keep track of win/loss records),
(potentially videos)
- **Key Relationships:** Information about an opponent as reminders for the next
time you ever go against them in the future
## User Experience
- **User Flows:** User logs in -> Picks their prefered sport ->
- (if they picked mma) weight class estimate, height estimate, wins/losses,
strength/weaknesses
